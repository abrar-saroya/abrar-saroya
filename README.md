Teaching machines the nuances of human communication.

I am a Computational Linguist with an M.Phil in Applied Linguistics. My work focuses on bridging the gap between linguistic theory and computational implementation. Unlike standard NLP engineering, I approach problems with a deep understanding of language structure, acquisition, and usage.
